# Did you know?
The idea for this game and the mechanic for auto-locking doors after others have been opened was largely inspired by a random dream I had in 2023. Even the sparse rooms were a detail from said dream that I managed to painstakingly recall.

Following a similar inspiration, the repository name and overall premise of the game is a reference to a separate dream I had many years ago where my dad turned into a lycanthrope and tried to hunt me down.

The character you play as is the same pudgey wizard of the tabletops from [MERIO Reborn](https://github.com/daniel-tran/merio-reborn).
